# AgriVision

AgriVision is an innovative web and mobile application designed to empower farmers, agronomists, and agricultural stakeholders with actionable insights derived from Earth observation data. Leveraging NASA's remote sensing assets and other environmental data, AgriVision helps users make informed decisions about crop management, planting schedules, and agricultural trends.

## Why AgriVision?

In a world facing climate change and increasing agricultural demands, AgriVision helps farmers make data-driven decisions to ensure sustainable and efficient food production. By providing critical insights and forecasts, AgriVision aims to reduce crop failures, optimize resource use, and improve overall productivity in agriculture.

## Key Features

- **Crop Yield Prediction**: Uses weather patterns, soil conditions, and satellite imagery to predict crop yields and provide insights on resource management.
- **Optimal Planting Date Identification**: Recommends the best planting windows based on Earth observation data such as temperature, rainfall, and soil moisture.
- **Agricultural Trends Forecasting**: Forecasts agricultural trends using historical and satellite data to prepare for future challenges such as droughts, pests, and changes in growing seasons.
- **Real-Time Data Integration**: Utilizes NASAâ€™s Earth observation datasets (MODIS, Landsat, SMAP) and local weather data for real-time recommendations.
- **Mobile & Web Access**: Available as both a web and mobile application, making it accessible to users in the field and at the office.
